# agi-dev-releases

This repository is used as a placeholder for [Android GPU Inspector](https://gpuinspector.dev) dev-releases.

The [latest **stable** release of AGI is accessible here](https://github.com/google/agi/releases/latest).

Dev-releases are **unstable** preview releases for developers, they are NOT
stable releases. The [release.md](releases.md) file lists dev-releases.

The [latest **unstable** dev-release is available
here](https://github.com/google/agi-dev-releases/releases/latest).

## How to get notifications for new dev-releases

Launch AGI, go to the `Edit -> Preferences` menu, and tick both “Automatically
check for AGI updates” and “Include unstable developer releases” options:

Make sure to **relaunch AGI**.

When a new dev-release is published, a "New update available" notification will
be displayed on the startup screen:

Clicking on this notification will bring you to the latest dev-release page on
GitHub from where you can download the build relevant to your platform.
